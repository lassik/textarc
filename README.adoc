TextArc is a new archive file format that is text-based. Unlike a zip
or tar file, a TextArc file is just an ordinary text file. If you
store text files in the archive, you can read their contents by
opening the archive file in a text editor or web browser.

* TextArc is line-oriented. It is designed to be very easy to parse
safely and extend cleanly.

* TextArc is designed to handle arbitrary binary data, Unix vs Windows
newlines (even when mixed in the same file), long lines, missing or
multiple final newlines, blank lines, and trailing whitespace with no
effort from the user.

* TextArc supports the usual file attributes with almost the same
syntax as link:https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mtree[BSD
mtree].

* TextArc does not compress files inside the archive (it would be
silly to use text to compress data). However, it's easy to compress an
entire archive using gzip, bzip2 or any other file compressor.

TextArc was created as a clean alternative to the age-old
link:https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shar[shar] hack.
